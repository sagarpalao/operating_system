# Operating Systems
This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Operating Systems. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. Clock Paging
2. Dining Philosophers and different solutions to it using Semaphore, Group Semaphore
3. Disk Scheduling algorithms
4. FCFS
5. FIFO
6. LRU
7. Paging
8. Priority Based Scheduling
9. Reader Writer controlled by Semaphores
10. Round Robin Scheduling
11. Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling
12. Sleeping Barber Problem
13. Shell Scripts (File Operation, Loops, Switch Case, etc.)
14. Comparison of different Scheduling algorithms
